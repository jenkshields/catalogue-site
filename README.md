# Catalogue

Catalogue is a gallery space situated within Penny Lane Records in Sydenham, showing a wide range of artists creating new works.

This website is built using Typescript and Gatsby, and styled with styled-components. Each exhibition page is coded fresh by hand to showcase each exhibition's unique aesthetic style.

This repository is open-source to showcase the work.
